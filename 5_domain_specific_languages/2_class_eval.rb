# 'class_eval' method - evaluates the string or block in the context of the class,
# allowing you to reopen the class and define additional behavior on it.

# Creating a method inside the block defines an instance method on the class.
# Using 'class_eval' on a class is the same as explicitly defining the method in the class itself. Benefits:
#  1 - allows you to add behavior to a class dynamically.
#  2 - the code will fail immediately, if the class doesnâ€™t exist (or if you misspelled the class name).
